.SH NAME
ccs-init \- Load TOMOYO Linux's policy automatically
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ccs-init

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is automatically called to load policy from files into kernel when /sbin/init starts.
.PP
This program copies the following files.
.IP
/etc/ccs/system_policy.base + /etc/ccs/system_policy.conf => /proc/ccs/system_policy
.IP
/etc/ccs/exception_policy.base + /etc/ccs/exception_policy.conf => /proc/ccs/exception_policy
.IP
/etc/ccs/domain_policy.base + /etc/ccs/domain_policy.conf => /proc/ccs/domain_policy
.IP
/etc/ccs/profile.base + /etc/ccs/profile.conf => /proc/ccs/profile
.IP
/etc/ccs/manager.base + /etc/ccs/manager.conf => /proc/ccs/manager
.IP
/etc/ccs/meminfo.base + /etc/ccs/meminfo.conf => /proc/ccs/meminfo
.PP
If /etc/ccs/ccs\-post\-init is an executable file, /etc/ccs/ccs\-post\-init is also executed.
You can use /etc/ccs/ccs\-post\-init for additional initialization purpose.
For example, you can write
.IP
#! /bin/sh
.IP
echo manage_by_non_root > /proc/ccs/manager
.IP
chown \fB\-R\fR demo /proc/ccs/
.PP
in the /etc/ccs/ccs\-post\-init and chown/chmod like
.IP
chown \fB\-R\fR demo /etc/ccs/
.IP
chmod 755 /usr/lib/ccs/
.PP
to allow policy management by user "demo" as well as user "root".
.SH EXAMPLES

None.
.SH NOTES

 If something went wrong, a prompt is shown so that the administrator can take action before the kernel gets panic.

 You don't need to invoke this program manually.

 To load policy after /sbin/init starts, use ccs-loadpolicy instead.
